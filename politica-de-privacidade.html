        <h1>Privacy Policy for Speak Up</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: June 4, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Speak Up! This Privacy Policy explains how Speak Up ("I," "me," "my") collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you visit my website at <a href="https://speakup-4ve.pages.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://speakup-4ve.pages.dev/</a> (the "Website") and use its features. This includes when you take our motivation quiz, or use links to contact me via WhatsApp or schedule appointments through Google Calendar. Your privacy is important to me, and I am committed to protecting your personal data.</p>

        <h2>2. Who I Am (Data Controller)</h2>
        <p>Speak Up is a service provided by <strong>Luiz Felipe Angelo Miranda</strong>, a freelance English professor based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

        <h2>6. Legal Basis for Processing Your Information (LGPD Compliance)</h2>
        <p>I process your personal information based on the following legal grounds as set out by the LGPD:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your Consent:</strong> For most of the information I collect – such as when you fill out a contact form, take the quiz, or (in the future) sign up for a newsletter – I do so based on your clear and freely given consent. You provide this consent by voluntarily offering your information for these specified purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> (Future Addition) For website analytics (like Google Analytics), I may process data based on my legitimate interest in understanding and improving my website and services. I will always ensure this is balanced with your rights and freedoms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can withdraw your consent at any time for activities where consent is the legal basis.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
        <p>Your trust is important, and I do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
        <p>However, to provide my services and operate my Website, I use some third-party platforms:</p>

        </ul>
        <p>I recommend you review the privacy policies of these third-party services to understand their data practices.</p>

        <h2>8. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>I take reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, or disclosure. The information you provide may be stored on password-protected devices and secure cloud-based services. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>I will keep your personal information only for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you inquire about classes, I'll keep your information to manage our communications and for a reasonable period in case you decide to enroll later.</li>
            <li>(Future Addition) If you subscribe to my newsletter, I'll keep your email address until you unsubscribe.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Your Rights Under LGPD</h2>

        <h2>11. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p><em>(This section will be more relevant and may need expansion once Google Analytics is implemented.)</em></p>
        <p>Cookies are small text files stored on your device (computer, tablet, smartphone) when you visit a website.</p>
        <p>Currently, my Website has limited use of cookies. However, I plan to use Google Analytics, which uses cookies to collect information about how visitors use the Website. This information helps me understand user activity (like which pages are most popular) and improve the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website will generally be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.</p>
        <p>You can usually manage or disable cookies through your internet browser settings.</p>

        <h2>12. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>My English classes for children are marketed to and arranged with parents or legal guardians. I do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children without verifiable parental consent.</p>
        <p>If you are a parent or guardian and you provide information about your child (such as their name or age for class suitability), you do so with the understanding that this information will be used solely for the purpose of discussing and providing English classes for your child. If you believe your child has provided personal information to me without your consent, please contact me immediately so I can take appropriate steps.</p>

        <h2>13. Links to Other Websites</h2>
        <p>My Website may contain links to other websites (like WhatsApp and Google Calendar, as mentioned, and potentially others in blog posts or resources). This Privacy Policy only applies to my Website. If you click on a link to another website, you should read their privacy policy.</p>

        <h2>14. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in my practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. If I make changes, I will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. I encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how I am protecting your information.</p>
